class planobject(plantype.planobject_base, metaclass=plantype):
    """Base class for objects that are based on lazy calculation plans.

    `planobject` is the base-class for all objects that use `immlib` `plan`
    objects as their base type. Objects that inherit from `planobject` (which
    uses metaclass `plantype`) are defined in the same way that calculation
    plans are defined. Any attributes of the class (including those inherited
    from base classes) that are calculations (see `immlib.calc` and
    `immlib.plan`) are turned into a plan. The inputs of the plan are the
    required parameters for the class, and the outputs of the plan become the
    attributes of the class, which are resolved lazily like in `plandict`s.

    The `__init__` function of a `planobject` is special. During the `__init__`
    function only, the parameters of a `planobject` function can be set using
    the usual `setattr` interface. All `planobject`s are immutable once they
    have been initialized, however. At the end of the `__init__` function, the
    object must have all of its parameters set, otherwise an error is raised. If
    no `__init__` function is defined, then the `planobject` default init
    function calls `merge` on its arguments and keywords; the resulting dict
    must be a dictionary of the class's parameters.

    `planobject` types must not overload the following methods, as they are used
    by the `planobject` / `plantype` system. These are:
      * `__new__`
      * `__setattr__`
      * `__getattr__ `
