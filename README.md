`immlib` is a lightweight Python library that simplifies the design of
application programming interfaces (APIs) for scientific libraries. The name
immlib comes from the libraryâ€™s philosophy of using immutable data to simplify
scientific workflows.

`immlib` is heavily based on the library
[`pimms`](https://github.com/noahbenson/pimms), which effectively served as a
prototype for `immlib`. Both libraries were motivated by a number of observations
about the design of scientific software and are an attempt to make some of these
problems easier to manage.
